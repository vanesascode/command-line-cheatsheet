# Command line cheatsheet

In command-line interfaces, a command usually consists of a utility, flags, and arguments. Here's a breakdown of each component: 
 
**1. Utility:** The utility is the main executable or program that performs a specific task or operation. It is the command you run to execute a particular action. Examples of utilities include "ls" for listing files, "mkdir" for creating directories, or "ping" for testing network connectivity. 
 
**2. Flags/Options:** Flags, also known as options, modify the behavior of the utility. They are typically preceded by a hyphen (-) or double hyphen (--). Flags can enable/disable certain features, provide additional information, or change the default behavior of the utility. For example, the "-l" flag in the "ls" command is used to display detailed file information, while the "--recursive" flag in the "cp" command is used to copy directories and their contents recursively. 
 
**3. Arguments:** Arguments are the inputs or parameters passed to the utility to specify the specific files, directories, or settings to be used. They provide the necessary information for the utility to perform its intended task. Arguments are typically provided after the utility and any flags. For example, in the command "mkdir -p new_directory", "new_directory" is the argument specifying the name of the directory to be created. 
 
It's important to note that the usage of utilities, flags, and arguments can vary depending on the specific command-line interface, operating system, or utility being used.

## ðŸ”· To print:

`echo "hello world"`

## ðŸ”· To print the current working directory:

`pwd`

"pwd" stands for "print working directory"

## ðŸ”· To list the names of all files in the current directory, one file per line:

`ls -1`

 The "-1" option ensures that each file is listed on its own line for better readability.

## ðŸ”· To print the contents of a file (e.g. "access.log") in the current directory:

`cat access.log`

'cat' is short for "concatenate" and is primarily used to display the contents of one or more files. However, it can also be used to create, combine, or manipulate files.
